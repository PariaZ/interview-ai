# Abuse Escalation Guidelines

## 1. Types of Abuse
The following reports require investigation:
- Phishing or credential-harvesting pages
- Malware distribution or malicious redirects
- Botnet or command-and-control activity
- Spam campaigns
- Illegal or harmful content
- Network penetration attempts

Domains under investigation may be temporarily suspended until the issue 
is resolved.

## 2. Immediate Actions
For high-risk or ongoing abuse, Support may take immediate action:

- Suspended immediately
- Removed from DNS
- Flagged for additional review

Emergency suspension may occur **without prior notice** if the activity 
poses immediate harm.

## 3. When to Escalate to the Abuse Team
A support ticket **must** be escalated to the Abuse Team under any of the 
following conditions:

- Law enforcement or regulatory requests are involved
- Multiple abuse complaints have been received for the same domain
- The customer disputes an abuse-related suspension
- Abuse indicators persist after customer remediation
- Malware, phishing, or C2 activity is strongly suspected based on 
evidence
- The domain is part of a larger coordinated attack or botnet

Escalation ensures proper forensic review and compliance with 
legal/regulatory requirements.

## 4. Investigation and Timeline
The Abuse Team typically responds within **24–48 hours**.  
During the investigation:
- Domain suspension may remain active
- Additional evidence or identity verification may be requested
- Analysts may perform technical review (URL scans, header checks, log 
analysis)

If insufficient evidence is available, the abuse team may request 
clarification from the reporter or registrant.


## 5. Reinstatement of Suspended Domains
A suspended domain may be reinstated only after:
1. All abusive content or activity is removed  
2. The customer provides proof of remediation (e.g., screenshots, logs, 
audit results)  
3. WHOIS information is confirmed accurate (if relevant)  
4. The Abuse Team approves reinstatement  

Reinstatement typically occurs within **15–30 minutes** after approval.
