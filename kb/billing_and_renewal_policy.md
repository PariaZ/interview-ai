# Billing & Renewal Policy

## 1. Renewal Requirements
Domain names must be renewed before their expiration date to avoid service 
interruption. 
Renewals can be:
- Manual (initiated by the customer)
- Automatic (if auto-renew is enabled)

The renewal fee is charged to the default payment method on the account.

## 2. Expiration & Grace Periods
When a domain expires, the following states apply:

### 2.1 Grace Period
For most TLDs, there is a **0–30 day grace period** after expiration.  
During this time:
- The domain may stop resolving.
- Email services may stop working.
- The customer can still renew at the regular renewal price.

### 2.2 Redemption Period
After the grace period, the domain may enter a **Redemption Period 
(typically 30 days)**.  
During this period:
- The domain is removed from the DNS zone.
- A redemption fee may apply in addition to the renewal fee.

### 2.3 Pending Delete
After redemption, the domain enters a final 5-day state called **Pending 
Delete**, during which:
- The domain cannot be renewed
- The name will be released to the public registry

## 3. Billing Failures
Renewal or service continuation may fail due to:
- Expired or declined credit card
- Chargeback or disputed payment
- Disabled auto-renew setting
- Insufficient account balance (if applicable)

If billing fails:
1. A notification email is sent.
2. The system retries payment according to internal retry logic.
3. The domain may eventually expire if payment is not completed.

## 4. Suspension Due to Chargebacks
If a payment is reversed by the issuing bank:
- The domain may be **suspended immediately**
- DNS services may be disabled
- Support may require identity verification before restoring access

This suspension is separate from WHOIS or abuse-based actions.

## 5. Reactivating an Expired or Suspended Domain
To restore service:
1. Pay the outstanding renewal amount.
2. Pay any applicable redemption or chargeback fees.
3. Contact Support if DNS does not automatically restore.

Most reactivations complete within **15–30 minutes** after payment.
