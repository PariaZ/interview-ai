# Domain Suspension Policy

## 1. Reasons for Suspension
A domain may be suspended for any of the following reasons:
- Missing, invalid, or unverifiable WHOIS contact information
- Violation of Acceptable Use Policies (AUP)
- Abuse complaints such as phishing, malware, or spam
- Failure to respond to verification notices within the required timeframe
- Unresolved billing or chargeback issues

## 2. Notification Attempts
The system sends an email to the WHOIS contact address before suspension.
If WHOIS information is inaccurate or inaccessible, notification may fail.

## 3. Section 4.2 — WHOIS-Based Suspension
Domains suspended due to WHOIS inaccuracy require the following steps:
1. Update WHOIS information with accurate contact details.
2. Complete email or phone verification if requested.
3. Contact support to request reinstatement.
4. The Abuse or Compliance Team validates the updates and restores the 
domain.

## 4. DNS Behavior During Suspension
When suspended:
- DNS may stop resolving  
- Website and email services may become unavailable  
- The domain may display a suspension notice page 

## 5. Reactivation Timeline
