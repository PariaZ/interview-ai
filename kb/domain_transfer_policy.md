# Domain Transfer Policy

## 1. Eligibility for Transfer
A domain may be transferred to another registrar if:
- It has been registered for at least **60 days**
- It is not within the 60-day post-transfer lock period
- The domain is not subject to legal or registry lock
- The WHOIS contact email is accessible (for confirmation)

Domains involved in fraud, dispute, or chargeback investigations may be 
locked and ineligible for transfer.

## 2. Required Information
The following information is required to initiate a transfer:
- The domain name to be transferred
- The **EPP/Auth Code** provided by the current registrar
- Access to the registrant’s WHOIS email for approval

If the EPP code does not match registry records, the transfer will fail.

## 3. Section 3.2 — Reasons a Transfer May Fail
A domain transfer may be rejected for the following reasons:
- Incorrect or invalid Auth Code
- Domain is locked (“ClientTransferProhibited”)
- WHOIS email approval not completed
- Domain is within the 60-day ICANN transfer lock
- Unpaid renewal or active chargeback case
- Domain is expired beyond the grace period

The system will send a notification if a transfer attempt fails.

## 4. Approving a Transfer
Once initiated, an approval email is sent to the WHOIS registrant contact.  
The registrant must:
1. Review the transfer request  
2. Click the approval link  
3. Confirm the transfer with the receiving registrar  

Transfers typically complete within **5–7 days**, unless expedited by the 
losing registrar.

## 5. Canceling a Transfer
A registrant may cancel an outgoing transfer by:
- Locking the domain before approval is completed
- Contacting Support and requesting cancellation
- Ignoring the approval request email

Once the transfer completes, cancellation is no longer possible.

## 6. Transfer After Expiration
Some TLDs allow transfer during the grace period if:
- The domain has not entered Redemption
- The EPP code is still valid

Extra fees may apply depending on registry rules.
